Introduction: In this research, we will examine Softlooms Clothing's current IT infrastructure and suggest a cloud computing strategy suitable for a company of its size and breadth. Cost, resource allocation, security, and scalability considerations will serve as the foundation for our study and recommendations.
We will first give a brief overview of the company, Softlooms Clothing, before talking about the current IT setup and making suggestions for future deployment.

## Softlooms Clothing:

Manufacture Clothing with Softlooms is a leading Kerala-based clothing supplier in Kerala.
They helped many startups with sourcing, production, delivery & fast turnaround.
They manufacture high-quality apparel and provide customers with long-term clothing. They are the manufacturers and the  partner with the one-stop solution for all the requirements of the customers.

# Current IT setup and Recommendations:

This section examines several elements of the current IT setup and offers suggestions for potential deployments. We strive to offer justification and logic for each advice based on factors like cost, security, scalability, and resource allocation. The company website and customer relationship management will be the report's primary focal areas. Email communication and online store functionality. 
While supportive information systems have rapidly transformed into Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, mission-critical ERP’s largely remain in more conventional operation models (Juha Kinnunen,2021). We will primarily concentrate on SaaS because it is the most appropriate and obvious way for a company the size and complexity of Softlooms to realize the benefits of cloud computing out of the three types of standard services available on the cloud: infrastructure as a service (laaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and
software as a service (SaaS). Larger, more complicated enterprises are more likely to use PaaS and laaS.

## Enterprise Resource Planning:

Softlooms currently relies on an unprofessional way to manage their enterprise resource management, which requires specialized IT administration resources for tracking, maintaining, and supporting the program. As the customer base expands and more data is gathered, the demands on internal resources increase. 
Underutilization of server hardware can lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources. 
Cloud ERP solutions allow organizations of all sizes to support and coordinate key business processes by leveraging virtualization. (Vegard Uri Sørheller, 2018).
With a traditional setup, like Softlooms' local server, data backups can be time-consuming and often require off-site storage for security and risk reduction purposes.
Remote access to business systems is essential for flexibility and productivity. It introduces the risk of sensitive business data being compromised if laptops or other devices are lost or stolen.

## ERP recommendations
Implementing an ERP system can revolutionize the way businesses like Softlooms operate. By consolidating various functions and processes into a unified platform, an ERP system enhances efficiency, optimizes resource utilization, and improves data security. The system quality attributes of cloud-ERPs identified are scalability, availability, accessibility, reliability, and the ability to compose and customize web services, motivating organizations to adopt cloud-based ERP. (Moutaz Haddara, 2022),
 Softlooms can overcome the challenges they currently face with their current system, underutilized server hardware, data backup requirements, and remote access concerns by embracing ERP. By doing so, they will unlock new opportunities for growth, enhance customer service, and position themselves as a competitive player in the market.

## Company website:

Currently, a dedicated web server that was set up to accommodate consumer load during peak hours hosts the website. The capacity is frequently underutilized because the servers are configured to handle the seasonal high demand.

## Recommendations
Currently, a dedicated web server that was set up to accommodate consumer load during peak hours hosts the website. The capacity is frequently underutilized because the servers are configured to handle the seasonal high demand.

## E-mail:

Using Office 365 right now. This makes internal and external communication within the company quick and simple. We would advise keeping this service in the cloud as maintaining and managing an Exchange server would be quite expensive and time-consuming.
By paying for the service on a subscription basis, Softlooms can cut costs and complexity.

## Recommendation
No change 

## Final Thoughts

Given its aspirations for expansion, Softlooms should adopt a cloud first strategy. This is mainly because service provisioning has a high degree of automation built in, which is advantageous because it allows Softlooms to swiftly design and deploy its cloud services. Cloud service providers can resume service more quickly than a single customer operating their own data center because of infrastructure capacity and resource availability. 

The advantages of being a smaller company, like Softlooms, include agility, flexibility, and the comparatively simple adoption of cloud services.
Similar to this, the general cloud strategy we advise will be Public Cloud, which is shared on demand infrastructure and resources provided by a provider. Due to its scalability, simplicity in deployment, and affordability, we suggest this strategy for Softlooms. The private cloud is frequently used to assure compliance with governance requirements, but because of the inherent costs to build and maintain it, we did not feel it appropriate in this case

## Summary of additional benefits and disadvantages of migration to the cloud.

          Advantages
Disadvantages
Service responsiveness
Inability to govern the computing environment
Availability of services
Data leakage while processing may occur.
Corporate persistence
Security measures and privacy issues
Flexibility in payments
There is a risk of cloud outages and service disruption, and in-house businesses are more likely to experience these.
Demand-driven high-end computer services
